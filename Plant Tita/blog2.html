                  <h1>Rare Indoor Plants You Can Add To Your Collection (Philippines)</h1>
                  
                  <h3>Monstera</h3>
                  <h4>Botanical Name: Monstera Deliciosa</h4>
                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>A massive floor plant with one of design's most recognizable leaves. The nickname "Swiss cheese" refers to the iconic splits and holes in its leaves, while "breadfruit" refers to its corn-shaped fruit.</p>

                  <h4>Care Tips</h4>
                  <p>Allow the soil to dry between waterings and water it every 1-2 weeks. Water more frequently in brighter light and less frequently in lower light. Normal room humidity is sufficient, but humid conditions are preferred if possible. Bright to medium indirect light is ideal. It is not suited to intense, direct sunlight, but it can be acclimated to tolerate it.</p>
                
                  
                  <h3>Philodendron Birkin</h3>
                  <h4>Botanical Name: Philodendron “Birkin”</h4>
                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>This indoor plant has smaller, completely green foliage as a juvenile. And as it matures, the creamy variegation becomes more noticeable with each new leaf. Some growth even has completely cream-colored leaves.</p>

                  <h4>Care Tips</h4>
                  <p>Birkin plants thrive in warm, humid environments that resemble their native tropics. Never go below 13°; a good range is between 18° and 30°. Keep any drafts or strong winds away from your Birkin plants. A healthy plant thrives in a humidity range of 40–70%. This can be accomplished by frequently misting your Philodendron Birkin or by combining it with other indoor plants. The other plants will contribute to increasing the humidity in your growing area.</p>


                  <h3>Philodendron Ginny</h3>
                  <h4>Botanical Name: : Rhaphidophora Tetrasperma</h4>
                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>The mini Monstera, mini split leaf, and philodendron ginnie are additional names for Monstera Ginny. In nature, the plant will climb trees by rapping its aerial roots around the trunk that is hanging down from the upper branches. It is a rare tropical aroid with small ornamental leaves with split lobes about 6" across.</p>

                  <h4>Care Tips</h4>
                  <p>The Rhaphidophora Tetrasperma plant requires constant moisture, but it shouldn't be soaked or drowned. Too much time spent sitting on wet soil may cause compaction, which may result in root rot. Always wait until the soil is at least partially dry before watering.</p>

                  <h3>Ruffled Fan Palm (Licuala Grandis)</h3>
                  <h4>Botanical Name: Licuala grandis</h4>
                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>A lowland rain forest palm with an incredibly elegant appearance that originates from the Vanuatu Islands and the Solomon Islands close to Australia's coast. Its pleated, circular, undivided leaves with notched tips are very distinctive.</p>
                  <h4>Care Tips</h4>
                  <p>The Licuala Palm thrives on sparingly applied, deep watering. After the top few inches of the soil have dried, thoroughly water the area. Two or three times per week, mist the plant to maintain a comfortable humidity level.</p>

                  <h3>Anthurium Black Love</h3>
                  <h4>Botanical Name: Anthurium (Andraeanum Group)</h4>
                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>Attention anthurium enthusiasts: there is a rare Dutch anthurium hybrid with black flowers. The unusual, long-lasting, black to dark chocolate flowers stay on the plant for a few months. Since it prefers to be grown in partial sun, "Black Love" is a compact plant that looks great in any indoor light garden or east or west-facing window. It is the ideal gift for the busy person in your life because of its tough nature and relatively simple maintenance requirements. Additionally, it makes a cool Halloween plant. This 4" potted plant is in bloom.</p>
                  <h4>Care Tips</h4>
                  <p>When the top few inches of soil feel dry to the touch, water thoroughly, stopping when water begins to drain from the drainage holes. Avoid overwatering because anthurium roots can rot. Your anthurium will require more water as it receives more light and heat, so check the soil for dryness every few days.</p>
